# slack-age-bot
This is a simple Slack bot that calculates age.

To run : 

1. Replace app token and bot token with your own
2. Run: go get github.com/shomali11/slacker
3. Run: go build
4. Run: go run main.go

(Users need to have a slack workspace and be the admin of that workspace for it to work.)
